Description
===========

The system offers a real-time supervision of attacks on a private server. Two dashboards are available:

 * the first one shows port-scan attacks on the system (TCP and UDP scan)
 * the second one shows authenticated connections and failed authentication attempts to these two dashboards

All attacks are geolocated and can be viewed in real-time.

It's based on ELK technology (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) which is the standard of open-sourced SIEM (Security Informations and Events Management).

`Enjoy`_ !
